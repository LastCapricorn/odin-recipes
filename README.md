# odin-recipes

A 'recipe website' as part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

- creating folders and files from the CLI
- starting with HTML boilerplate, inserting headers, 
  paragraphs, images, links and lists (unordered, ordered and description)
- GIT: log, status, add, push from CLI, commit from code
  not sure about the comments...
- need to learn MarkDown(?), is it part of the Curriculum?
